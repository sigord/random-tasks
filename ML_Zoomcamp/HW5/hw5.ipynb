    "## Question 1\n",
    "\n",
    "* Install Pipenv\n",
    "* What's the version of pipenv you installed?\n",
    "* Use `--version` to find out\n",
    "\n",

    "## Question 4\n",
    "\n",
    "Now let's serve this model as a web service\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "Install [Docker](https://github.com/DataTalksClub/machine-learning-zoomcamp/blob/master/05-deployment/06-docker.md). \n",
    "We will use it for the next two questions.\n",
    "\n",
    "For these questions, we prepared a base image: `svizor/zoomcamp-model:3.10.12-slim`. \n",
    "You'll need to use it (see Question 5 for an example).\n",
    "\n",
    "This image is based on `python:3.10.12-slim` and has a logistic regression model \n",

    "\n",
    "## Question 5\n",
    "\n",
    "Download the base image `svizor/zoomcamp-model:3.10.12-slim`. You can easily make it by using [docker pull](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/pull/) command.\n",

    "## Dockerfile\n",
    "\n",
    "Now create your own Dockerfile based on the image we prepared.\n",

    "\n",

    "FROM svizor/zoomcamp-model:3.10.12-slim\n",
    "# add your stuff here\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Now complete it:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Install all the dependencies form the Pipenv file\n",
    "* Copy your Flask script\n",
    "* Run it with Gunicorn \n",
    "\n",
    "After that, you can build your docker image.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Question 6\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's run your docker container!\n",
    "\n",
    "After running it, score this client once again:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "url = \"YOUR_URL\"\n",
    "client = {\"job\": \"retired\", \"duration\": 445, \"poutcome\": \"success\"}\n",
    "requests.post(url, json=client).json()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
